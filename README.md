Adds the unfinished Clay Man into the game as a fast melee trash mob that can deal high damage to unwary players.

They can chase and keep up with sprinting players, but can be outmaneuvered by jumping and strafing.

Spawns on Abandoned Aqueduct, Aphelian Sanctuary, Sulfur Pools, Scorched Acres

Replaces Imps on Scorched Acres
